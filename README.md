# Sign-Language-Translator-Singo-
Sign Language Translator - Singo (Sign and Go)

Our project aims to create a Sign Language Translator App to improve communication for the deaf and hard of hearing. The problem statement is the difficulty in communicating with non-signers, which can lead to social isolation and limited access to information. Our research questions include what features would be most beneficial to users and how to improve accuracy and ease of use. Background information includes the prevalence of hearing loss and the lack of accessible communication options. Our team wants to tackle this problem because we believe that everyone deserves equal access to information and communication. Using design thinking, we aim to build a painkiller app that solves a significant problem for our users.
